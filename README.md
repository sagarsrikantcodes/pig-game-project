# Pig Game Project

## Overview

The Pig Game is a fun, interactive dice game for two players. Players take turns to roll a die and accumulate points. The objective is to reach a total score of 100 points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current turn score and the other player takes their turn. Players can choose to hold their score to add it to their total score, or roll the die again for a chance to accumulate more points.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Random dice rolling mechanics
- Current score tracking for each player

- Visual feedback with dice images
